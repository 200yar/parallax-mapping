Three.js parallax mapping example [launch it](http://www.shapespark.com/labs/parallax-mapping)

Parallax shader is authored by Igor Dykhta (with very small modifications) and is described in detail on [Igor's blog](http://sunandblackcat.com/tipFullView.php?topicid=28).
This version is simplified, it does not use dynamic lighting and self shadowing.

[Morten S. Mikkelsen's shader](http://mmikkelsen3d.blogspot.sk/2012/02/parallaxpoc-mapping-and-no-tangent.html) is used to avoid conventional tangent space transforms.
